<h2>Task 1 (Instructions)</h2>

<p>On the next page, you will see a visualization for overnight stays in the fictional Crait National Park with instructions on how to read the visualization. 
  After you read the instructions and study the visualization, you will be asked a set of questions measuring your understanding of the visualization.
  <strong>Remember, you cannot go back or reload for the duration of this study.</strong></p>
  <h4>Please read carefully:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>You will have <span class="missing">[two minutes]</span> to study the visualization with the breakdown. Please read and study the visualization carefully.</li>
    <li>Once you move on to the multiple choice questions, <strong>you will not be able to go back or reload.</strong></li>
    <li>If you do not remember the answer, <strong>please do not guess. </strong>Every question has a "I don't know" option.</li>
    <li>Keep in mind, the weather patterns in this park may or may not match what you expect.</li>
  </ul>
